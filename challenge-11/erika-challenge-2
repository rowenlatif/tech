Problem Statement:
-------------------
Your task is to design a program that processes the given data and produces a single output. 
The output should be a summary of customer activity based on the data provided.
There are multiple ways to approach this task, but thereâ€™s one correct output.
The winning team is the one who submits 

Objective: 
----------
Design a program that outputs the total number of unique customers who made purchases over a certain threshold 
and the total amount of money spent by these customers.

The fake data you will work with consists of transactions, and you need to:
- Identify the unique customers.
- Calculate the total amount spent by all those customers who made a purchase greater than a specified threshold (answer should be a single number).

Fake Data:
-----------
Here is the fake transaction data (for customers making purchases):

Instructions:
-------------
1. Filter the transactions: 
   - Only consider customers whose **individual transaction** amount is greater than $100.
   
2. Track unique customers: 
   - You must track and only count customers who have made at least one transaction greater than $100.

3. Output Format:
   - Total number of unique customers who made at least one purchase greater than $100.
   - Total amount spent by those unique customers (sum of all their transactions).

---

Example Output:
---------------
For the provided fake data, you will produce a summary like this (based on the data given):

Unique Customers: _____
Total Money Spent: _____

---

Things to Consider:
-------------------
- Your solution should be flexible, allowing easy modifications if the dataset changes.
- Multiple approaches can be taken, make sure to brainstorm the best solution that matches your team's strengths before implementing
- The first and second teams to get the correct answer for unique customers and $$ spent will recieve bonus points, but the winning team is the team 
  with the best implementation.

---

Judging Criteria:
-----------------
- Correctness: Does the program produce the right output?
- Efficiency: How well does your solution handle this data? Is it scalable to larger datasets?
- Speed: Did you get your solution to the judges in an effective time manner?
   - ** First team to submit the right answers will recieve bonus points

Good luck! Please call a judge over if you have any questions on the problem or instructions!
