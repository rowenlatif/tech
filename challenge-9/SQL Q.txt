SQL and Relational Algebra Challenge Question

Directions: Reference a standard Chinook database model

Question: A particular creator is looking for some short audio clips that are dramatic or suspenseful. Give the id, name, and duration (in milliseconds) of any tracks from the “Quick clips” playlist are labeled with the genre of dramatic or suspenseful. 

Part One: Construct a Relational Algebra query
R1 → σName = ′Quick Clips′​(Playlist)
R2 → πTrackId​(PlaylistTrack ⋈PlaylistTrack.PlaylistId = R1.PlaylistId ​R1)
R3 → Track ⋈Track.TrackId = R2.TrackId​ R2
R4 → σName =′Dramatic′ ∨ Name=′Suspenseful′​(Genre)
R5 → R3 ⋈R3.GenreId = R4.GenreId​ R4
Result → πTrackId, Name, Milliseconds​(R5)

Part Two: Construct a SQL query 
SELECT T.TrackId, T.Name, T.Milliseconds
FROM Playlist P
JOIN PlaylistTrack PT ON P.PlaylistId = PT.PlaylistId
JOIN Track T ON PT.TrackId = T.TrackId
JOIN Genre G ON T.GenreId = G.GenreId
WHERE P.Name = 'Quick Clips'
  AND (G.Name = 'Dramatic' OR G.Name = 'Suspenseful');
